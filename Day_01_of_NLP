# Text Processing

--> Tokenization - splitting text into words or sentences

Purpose:
In NLP tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis each token is used for analysis. Here token represents each word in a sentence.
In NER (Named Entity Recognition), we identify entities like names of places, people, organization etc.... for which tokens are used

--> Stemming - Reducing the word to their base form
--> Lemmatization - Reducing the word to their base form with meaning

Purpose:
- Reducing variations - One word can be of many forms due to conjugation, tense, plurality
- Improving Text-preprocessing

# Difference between Stemming and Lemmatization, when to use which technique?

Stemming:
- Loss of meaning
- computationally less expensive
- suitable where speed is a critical factor
e.g.: information retrieval

Lemmatization:
- No loss of meaning
- computationally more expensive
- suitable for tasks requiring deeper understanding
e.g.: sentiment analysis, machine transalation


# Text Preprocessing:

It invloves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis (or) modeling

Some of the text preprocessing tasks are:
- Noise Reduction - Raw data contains text in the form of special characters, HTML Tags, punctuation

- Standardization - Text data from various sources have various formats, spellings. Preprocessing standardizes the data to ensure integrity and uniformity in analysis.

- Stop word removal - Words like is, the, and, etc.. does not add value in analysis. These words will be removed to reduce the data size and for efficient analysis

- Lower Casing
- Removing Special characters
- Handling Numbers
- Feature Extraction
- Spell check
- Date operations

# Common NLP Tasks:

- Text classification - assigning categories or labels to text documents e.g.: spam detection, topic classification
- Named Entity Recognition - Identifying and classifying named entities such as names of people, company, date and more
- Parts-of-speech Tagging(POS Tagging) - Assigning grammatical tags e.g.: noun, verb, adjective to each word
- Sentiment analysis - Determining the sentiment or emotional tone of piece of text
- Text Generation - Creating human like text that can be used for Chatbots, creative writing, content generation
- Machine Translation - Translating text from one language to another
- Speech Recognition - Converting spoken language into text
- Text Summarization - Automatically generating concise summaries of text, useful for news articles or document summarization
- Question Answering - Finding and providing answers to questions posed in natural language
- Text Clustering and Topic Modeling - Grouping categories of text together
- Coreference Resolution - Identifying different words or phrases in a text that refer to same entity
- Dependency Parsing - Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence by determining the relationships between words
- Conversational AI - Building chatbots or virtual assistants that can engage in human like conversations
